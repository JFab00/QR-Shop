# [Highschool Projects] QR Shop

The objective of this project was making a shop that, through the use of QR Codes, people would be able to scan the certain items using their mobilephones. When they have scanned all the products they wanted, then they would have to scan another QR code that had the purpose of making and giving the receipt to the user.  
  
(I need to edit some of the code because it's just dumb... then I will upload the content, as well as a link where you can try the shop)  
-TBC-
